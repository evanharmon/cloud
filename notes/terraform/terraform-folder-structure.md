# TERRAFORM FOLDER STRUCTURE

## Folder structure
For this cloud infrastructure repo, I went with the option #1 with dev / staging / prod environments
example `./terraform/environments/dev/account1/`

## For now - just using `dev` environment folder
`./terraform/environments/dev/eph-music-dev`

## Notes saved from AI advice on folder structure

## Account-Based Structuring Options

### Option 1: Environment-based with account differentiation
```
repository/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── account1/
│   │   └── account2/
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── account1/
│   │   └── account2/
│   └── prod/
│       ├── account1/
│       └── account2/
├── modules/
└── ...
```

### Option 2: Account-based with environment differentiation
```
repository/
├── accounts/
│   ├── account1/
│   │   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── staging/
│   │   └── prod/
│   └── account2/
│       ├── dev/
│       ├── staging/
│       └── prod/
├── modules/
└── ...
```

## Recommendations for Multiple Accounts

Generally, Option 2 (account-based structure) is considered a better practice when you have multiple AWS accounts because:

1. **Alignment with AWS's account strategy**: AWS recommends using separate accounts for isolation boundaries, which maps cleanly to your folder structure

2. **Clearer permission boundaries**: Teams often have permissions to specific accounts, making it easier to manage repository permissions

3. **Simpler state management**: You can more easily manage Terraform state files per account

4. **Blast radius containment**: Changes to one account won't affect others

5. **Account-specific configurations**: Some resources may only exist in specific accounts (like organization-level resources)

If your accounts serve different purposes (e.g., networking account, shared services account, application accounts), this approach makes even more sense as each account will likely have different types of resources.

You can still use consistent modules across accounts to maintain standardization, while keeping the account-specific configurations separate.

Would you like me to go deeper into how to structure the state files or backend configuration for this multi-account setup?
