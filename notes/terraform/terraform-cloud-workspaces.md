# TERRAFORM CLOUD WORKSPACES

## Org
decided to stick to a single org - `eph-core`

## Project
created a project `cloud-platform`

## Workspaces
Could do a workspace for `staging and prod` in the future.

Personal stacks will have their own workspaces.
created multiple variations of eks so far `cloud-aws-eph-eks-*`

NO workspace for dev - this means a personal stack can fully behave like staging / prod will.
